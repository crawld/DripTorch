# DripTorch 0.8.1 Release Notes

## Changes

### Changed wind direction to firing direction ([PR #130](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/130))

We changed all instances of `wind_direction` in the source code and docs to
`firing_direction` to disambiguate wind and slope driven fire progression.
