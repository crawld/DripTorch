# DripTorch 0.7.1 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

### Temporarily removed tests directory for Conda build ([PR #112](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/112))

The draft testing suite is breaking our Conda publishing workflow. The entire test directory has been temporarily removed. Test are intact in the [issue 109 branch](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/tree/issue109) and will be integrated prior to the next minor release.
