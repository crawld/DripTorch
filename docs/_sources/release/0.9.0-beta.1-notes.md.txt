# DripTorch 0.9.0-beta.1 Release Notes

## New Features

### Strip contour firing beta release ([PR #143](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/143))

The strip contour firing technique is working, but unstable. We will follow up with beta bumps until we reach a stable version of the new firing technique.

### Cloud-hosted DEM and on-the-fly grid reprojection ([PR #137](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/137))

These efforts support our goal to add contour following ignition patterns in version 0.9. The grid extraction and processing happens automatically behind the scenes.

### Contour-following strip ignition prototype ([PR #138](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/138))

This PR encompasses the prototype code for an algorithm to commpute the geodesic distance transform over a 2.5 dimensional surface representated as a 2 dimensional matrix. 


## Bug fixes

### Incorrect naming of EPSG 4326 ([PR #141](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/141))

Somehow we got in the habit of calling EPSG: 4326 'Web Mercator' while it's actually WGS84. We have updated the code and docs to semantically reference 4326 as WGS84.

```{warning}
This is a breaking change for users directly using the `mercator_to_utm` and `to_mercator` methods from the `Projector` class. 
```
