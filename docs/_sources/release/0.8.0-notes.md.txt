# DripTorch 0.8.0 Release Notes

## Highlights

- Use the optional `clockwise` parameter in the `head` and `back` pattern generators to control the direction of the igniter.
- The flank pattern generator now has an optional `spacing` argument for staggering igniters within a heat.
- The `heat_delay` bug for strip and flank ignition has been fixed.

## New features and improvements

### Directional arguments for backing and head fire ([PR #123](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/123))

We've added an optional `clockwise: bool` parameter to backing and head fire pattern generators. By default, the igniter will follow the boundary in the clockwise direction. Setting `clockwise = False` will send the igniter in the counter-clockwise direction.

### Igniter stagger for flank ignition ([PR #124](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/124))

The request for within-heat flank igniter spacing has been fulfilled. This feature was implemented in the same way as the strip ignition pattern generator; you can pass `spacing: float` parameter to the generator - spacing is the stagger distance in meters.

### Tests for firing techniques ([PR #113](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/113))

The new testing suite now includes validation tests for all implemented firing techniques.

### Minor doc fixes ([PR #125](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/125))

Fixed a few typos in the docs and updated the quickstart guide

## Bug fixes

### Heat delay error ([PR #121](https://github.com/silvxlabs/DripTorch/pull/121))

The between-heat time delay feature introduced in 0.7.0 was producing incorrect timings between heats and igniters. These issues have been resolved.
