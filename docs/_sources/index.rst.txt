DripTorch |version|
===================


DripTorch is simulation tool used to generate spatiotemporal ignition patterns
for prescribed fire planning and analysis. Ignition patterns are simulated within
a user-provided spatial boundary. The spatial boundary can be manipulated to account
for control line and black line placement. DripTorch offers a set of common firing techniques
that determine the arrangement of igniters and their respective paths and timing. We also
provide mapping utilities to help visualize the ignition patterns across space and time, and
export methods to write the ignition patterns to a variety of fire model formats.
